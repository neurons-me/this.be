# this.be

This project consists of two npm packages, `this.be` and `be.this`, designed to empower users in defining, managing, and utilizing personal data and backend functionalities effectively.

```bash
npm install this.be
```



### **this.be:** The State Guardian

It represents the heart of your application, maintaining a global state or context.
Every time there's a change, or when specific events occur, "this.be" takes note and acts as the guardian of that state, ensuring that it's accessible and known.

##### **be.this:** The State Enforcer

This module is the action-taker, adjusting and reconfiguring based on the state preserved by "this.be".
Think of it as a troubleshooter or a healer; it watches the state and acts when things aren't in harmony with it.



# this.be 

### The Heart of State Management

**Simplicity in Structure:** The this.be module embodies the essence of simplicity. By initializing with an optional initialState parameter, the flexibility to set a starting state or rely on a default empty object is achieved. This design ensures adaptability to various use cases right from the start.

**Versatility of Access:** The module is tailored for both specific and general state access. By using the getState method, the caller can choose to retrieve a specific state key or the entirety of the state, adding to the utility of the module.



**Modular State Modification:** setState and deleteState provide clear interfaces for modifying the state. This two-method approach covers the essentials of state management (adding & updating, and deleting), emphasizing a minimalistic yet effective design.



**Scalability:** The design is inherently scalable. As an application grows, additional methods or further subdivisions of the state can be effortlessly incorporated without disrupting the foundational design.



# The Synergy

**Interoperability:** Both modules are designed to work seamlessly with one another. be.this acts as an external actor, directing changes and updates to the state held within this.be.

**Decoupling:** While they are meant to work together, the modules are decoupled. be.this doesn't have knowledge of the inner workings of this.be; it simply calls its public methods. This ensures that changes in one module don't necessitate changes in the other.

**Unified State Management:** The combination of both modules offers a cohesive solution to state management. The separation of concerns - where this.be solely manages state and be.this orchestrates adjustments - enables a clear and maintainable approach to handling application state.

In summary, these modules, with their elegant designs, offer a blueprint for efficient state management, embodying key software design principles. They're primed for integration into larger ecosystems, serving as the backbone for robust application state handling.
